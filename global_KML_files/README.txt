global_KML_files

Some example files that may be useful when displaying whole mantle datasets.
The surface of the Earth is now projected so it appears to be the core-mantle
boundary.

Continents.kml: land surface areas (requires continents.png)
hot_spots.kml: major hotpot locations and tracks projected on the apparent Earth
               surface
lvz.kml: LLSVP isosurface polygon at -0.5% of the mean at each depth from the
         S20RTS model of Ritsema, J., and van Heijst, H.-J., 2000. "Seismic 
         imaging of structural heterogeneity in Earth's mantle: Evidence for 
         large-scale mantle flow", Science Progress, 83, 243-259.
OuterCore.kml: overlays the Earth's surface to hide features. Works best when
               'Terrain' in thel Layers panel is set to off. It may also be
               useful to tick the coastlines layer within 
               'Borders and Labels>Borders>Coastlines' for reference.
plateboundaries_usgs.kml: the same as for hot_spots.kml just for plate boundaries.
                          (requires Plates_legend.png)
